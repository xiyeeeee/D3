                In 2017, the majority of tourists arrived by land, contributing to an 8.32% growth, while the air and sea modes experienced slight declines of -3.49% and -21.60%, respectively. The following year, in 2018, land transport continued to dominate with a growth of 10.60%, while air and sea transport experienced declines of -3.21% and -11.38%, respectively. In 2019, air transport witnessed a significant 11.48% growth, becoming the leading mode of transport, while land and sea transport showed moderate changes. 
                <br><br>However, the year 2020 marked a drastic downturn for all modes, particularly air and land transport, with declines of -72.92% and -75.52%, respectively. Sea transport, while still experiencing a decline, remained relatively stable. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evident in the sharp reduction of tourist arrivals via all modes of transport in 2020. In 2021, recovery was observed, but land and sea transport continued to face challenges, showing substantial negative growth rates of -91.69% and -61.04%, respectively. </div>
